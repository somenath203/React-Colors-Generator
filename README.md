# React Colors Generator

This is a website created with the help of React.js where the user will be able to generate various tints and shades of a particular color by writing the hex code of that color in the input box and click on "Generate Colors" and also the user will be able to copy any hexcode of the generated colors in the clipboard by clicking on any box of the generated colors.

<br />

The input field also got validation which prevent user from entering any wrong hexcode.


In the website, the default value of the hex code in the input field is set to #f15025 so that the user after visiting the website for the first time can know how the website is working and how the colors are generated.

<br />

NOTE :- 

Tints are light values that are created by mixing a color with white, which increases lightness. 
<br />
Shades are dark values that are created by mixing a color with black, which decreases lightness.
